what does this do?
-------------------

well technically it makes a neural net of some arbitrarily determined size
and then attempts to fit a set of pictures depending on whether they
do or do not have a cat in them - pictures were randomly downloaded from
google image search and not curated

well what did you expect?
-------------------------

nothing - using just a plain neural net without any feature vectors and 
arbitrary rescaling of the images themselves is a bad idea. So this is
just an example of using PyBrain I guess?


ok I need many many more pictures + cpu's :P
